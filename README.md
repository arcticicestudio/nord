  A total of sixteen, carefully selected, low contrast pastel colors inspired by millennial pink for a eye-comfortable,
  but yet colorful ambiance.

<p align="center">
  It is a deliberately low contrast theme full of soothing contemporary colours designed to induce calmness and serenity and works well
  even on lower contrast displays. It is not eye fatiguing as it avoids high contrast colour changes and helps the eyes to focus on what
  is important.

<p align="center">Rosely is created for <strong>clear, uncluttered and elegant designs</strong> following a <strong>minimal and flat</strong> style pattern.
For syntax highlighting it aims to ensure an <strong>undisturbed focus on important parts of the code</strong>, a <strong>good readability</strong> and a <strong>quick visual distinction</strong> between the different syntax elements.</p>

<p align="center">Rosely consists of four named color palettes providing different syntactic meanings and color effects for dark & bright ambiance designs.</p>

[![Rosely Color Palette Overview](https://github.com/ChristineTham/rosely/raw/develop/images/rosely.png)](https://rosely.hellotham.com/docs/colors-and-palettes)

Rosely is a simple and uncluttered design system based on the warm and embracing gentle colour of rose quartz crystals (popularly known
as *Millennial Pink*), together with
a fresh and positive colour palette that symbolises adventuresome exploration of newness and originality.

If ever there was a time when we needed to surround ourselves with colours that infuse feelings of calmness and positivity into our environment,
it is now. As we continue down this path of uncertainty, a time marked by a global pandemic and social distancing coupled with social unrest
demanding action on equality and sustainability, people seek mindfulness and well-being as an antidote to the stress of modern day lives.

Rosely has a base colour that psychologically fulfil a yearning for reassurance and security.
Additional colours symbolises the brighter future that lies ahead that expresses a sense of playful freshness and optimism that brings a
smile to our face as it takes us forward.

All colors are numbered from `rosely0` to `rosely15` where each palette contains a different amount of colors, with semantic meanings
similar to the [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com) palette. The naming convention preserves the compatibility for terminal color schemes
and allows an uncomplicated use as base for such.

Rosely can be used as a drop in replacement package for *Nord* in projects simply by replacing the `nord` npm package with `rosely`.

Rosely is also compatible with the [base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/) architecture by redefining `base00` to `base0F` with
Rosely equivalent colours. Light and dark base16 schemes are included in this package.
